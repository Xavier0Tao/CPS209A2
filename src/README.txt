# Hi ðŸ‘‹ Dear TAs

1. Note that I added an if statement for cases when user enter invalid action.
2. I trimmed the input so that it allows leading and trailing space.
3. All functions work properly âœ…
4. I didn't implement Podcast. So dear you can skip the test of it.
5. To launch this application, first use *javac* to compile the **MyAudioUI** then run it.
